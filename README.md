> The future has arrived and cyberpunk is here. Ten years since the start of the unlawful sanctions against Secleia. We realized that our state was not ready for the First World Internet War, so in time we were able to protect our citizens by putting up a barrier, thereby separating the entire rotten world network from ours. After 5 years of development and technology import substitution, finally, the state company "Chaburnet" has launched an innovative training of the elite Internet troops, which should once and for all restore Secleiaâ€™s Internet world throughout the network. Now a young man of conscription age has a chance to serve his homeland by defending its web borders.
